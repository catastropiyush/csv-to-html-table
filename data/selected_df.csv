Ultrapure H-2 is formed from these compounds either via pyrolysis (i.e., a simple material heating) or via hydrolysis (chemical reaction with water). In both cases, a series of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have been designed to assist the process. Among the latter, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs, crystalline 3D porous lattices made of metallic nodes and organic polytopic linkers) have rapidly emerged as versatile candidates for this role. The nanoconfinement of lightweight hydrides in MOFs produces a hydride@MOF composite material. Hydride coordination to MOF exposed metal sites or its reaction with functional groups on the organic linkers facilitates the thermal decomposition, lowering the hydrogen release temperature and increasing the hydrogen production rate. For hydrolysis, MOFs are used as templates for the preparation of metal(0) nanopartides (NPs) uniformly distributed through preliminary impregnation with a solution containing a metal salt followed by reduction. The NPs@MOF are the real active species that catalyze the reaction between the hydride and water, with concomitant H-2 evolution. This perspective highlights the most representative literature examples of MOFs as heterogeneous catalysts (or catalyst supports) for H-2 production from inorganic lightweight hydrides. Future trends in the field will also be discussed.",,,,,"Rossin, Andrea/P-6379-2015; Giambastiani, Giuliano/E-3255-2016; Tuci, Giulia/T-5404-2017","Rossin, Andrea/0000-0002-1283-2803; Giambastiani, Giuliano/0000-0002-0315-3286; Tuci, Giulia/0000-0002-3411-989X; Luconi, Lapo/0000-0003-4407-6026",,,,,,,,,,,,,2155-5435,,,,,AUG,2017,7,8,,,,,5035,5045,,10.1021/acscatal.7b01495,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000407309100012,0

The change of Zr content can affect the stability of hydrides, which can have an important impact on the hydrogen storage performance. In order to explore the effect of Zr/Nb on hydrogen storage properties, Ti32.5V27.5Nb40-xZrx (x 1/4 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15) high entropy alloys composed of BCC phase are designed. It is found that with the increase of Zr/Nb, the dendritic microstructures first disappear and then gradually become coarse. The Zr-rich BCC phase and the Nb-rich BCC phase appear in the interdendritic and dendritic regions, respectively. Ti32.5V27.5Nb25Zr15 shows excellent activation performance, which is related to the Zr-rich BCC phase with the most catalytic phase on the surface. The hydrogen storage performance of low Zr/Nb composition is better at low temperature, and that of high Zr/Nb composition becomes better after rising to high temperature. This is because with the change of Zr/Nb, low temperature can promote the hydrogen absorption reaction and high temperature can increase the diffusion rate of hydrogen atoms in the interstitial positions of the alloy. Ti32.5V27.5Nb32.5Zr7.5 achieves the best hydrogen absorption capacity of 1.71 wt % at 150 degrees C. All components undergo a transition from the BCC phase to the FCC phase during the hydrogen absorption process,and then change to a single-phase BCC structure after dehydrogenation. With the increase of Zr content, the first step desorption temperature raises in turn, owing to the stronger thermal stability of hydride.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Mg2NiH4 produced by the reaction of MgH2 and Ni possesses a lower dehydrogenation enthalpy value than that of MgH2. Furthermore, carbon structure and 3DG provide more loading sites for metal particles and more channels for hydrogen diffusion.

However, the high temperatures required for the initiation of their hydrogen charging process and their slow kinetics prevent their integration in many practical applications. This paper discusses the challenge of addressing these issues by combining this kind of materials with the appropriate metal hydrides. For this purpose, the complex hydride, 2LiNH(2)-1.1MgH(2)-0.1LiBH(4)-3 wt.% ZrCoH3 (CxH) and the metal hydride,LaNi4.3Al0.4Mn0..3(MeH)have been selected as reference materials. The studied configuration corresponds to a tubular reactor where the metal hydride and the complex hydride, separated by a gas permeable layer, are embedded respectively in the centre and the annular ring of the reactor. A 1-dimensional finite element model and a dimensionless number comparing the dominance of the kinetics and the heat transfer processes have been developed to optimize the charging process for different thicknesses and volumetric ratios of the studied materials. For the selected cases, the influence of the thermal properties of the complex hydride and the operating conditions on the charging process is assessed. A sensitivity study has shown that the thermal conductivity of the CxH is the most important parameter influencing the hydrogen storage rate if thick MeH and CxH beds are considered. In contrast, the hydrogen loading time is significantly improved by increasing the coolant temperature for small thicknesses of the two storage media. Thereafter, the gravimetric and volumetric capacities resulting from the scale up of the optimized configurations to store 1 kg of hydrogen are calculated and results are discussed taking into account the interdependence of the different studied parameters.

Even though magnesium-based metal hydrides are considered potential hydrogen storage media, their sluggish dehydrogenation kinetics has limited their practical applications. In this study, Mg-Ni-based hydride with structural inhomogeneity was successfully prepared through a typical gas-solid reaction. The sample exhibited more remarkable hydrogen storage performance at relatively low temperatures compared to Mg2NiH4 prepared by the conventional method: it starts to release H-2 at similar to 175 degrees C and completes under 250 degrees C with a saturated capacity of 3.55 wt%, and desorbs 3.09 wt% H-2 within 1200 s at 200 degrees C. As proved by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, MgNi2 formed in situ during hydriding chemical vapor deposition can accelerate hydrogen release via the interfacial effect of Mg2NiH4/MgNi2. Moreover, the nano-micro Mg-Ni-based hydride exhibited excellent stability in the cyclic test without kinetic decay and capacity loss, which can be attributed to the high reactivity of the surface layer. The results provide alternative insights into the energy storage properties of metal hydrides with structural inhomogeneity and a new vision for the design and synthesis of practical energy storage materials.",,,,,"wei, wang/KHY-7669-2024; Zhang, Jiguang/ABF-9136-2022","Zhang, Jiguang/0000-0003-4136-1980",,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7488,2050-7496,,,,JUN 27,2023,11,25,,,,,13255,13265,,10.1039/d3ta02114a,0,,JUN 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001002749100001,0

The alloys have body-centred cubic (bcc) crystal structures and form face-centred cubic (fcc) metal hydrides with hydrogen-to-metal ratios close to 2 by hydrogenation. The onset temperature for hydrogen desorption, T-onset, decreases linearly with the valence-electron concentration, VEC. Moreover, the volumetric expansion per metal atom from the bcc alloys to the fcc hydrides, [(V/Z)(fcc) - (V/Z)(bcc)]/(V/Z)(bcc), increases linearly with the VEC. Therefore, it seems that a larger expansion of the lattice destabilizes the metal hydrides and that this effect can be tuned by altering the VEC. Kissinger analyses performed on the DSC measurements indicate that the destabilization is a thermodynamic rather than kinetic effect. Based upon these insights we have identified TiVCrNbH8 as a material with suitable thermodynamics for hydrogen storage in the solid state. This HEA-based hydride has a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 1.96 wt% H at room temperature and moderate H-2-pressures.

About 5 out of 6.9 wt.% of H-2 can be released in the range of 85-138 degrees C (heating rate 4 C min(-1)). Isothermal desorption results at 115 degrees C reveal that doped alanate exhibits dehydriding rate 7-8 times faster than that of pure LiAlH4. DSC measurements indicate that enthalpies of decomposition in LiAlH4 decrease significantly with doping. From Kissinger analysis, the apparent activation energies are estimated to be 59 kJ/mol, 70 kJ/mol and 99 kJ/mol for the decompositions of LiAlH4, Li3AlH6 and LiH, respectively.

Among these alloys, (Ti0.85Zr0.15)(1.1)Cr0.925MnFe0.075 has the best overall properties, with a hydrogen desorption pressure of 10.6 atm and a reversible capacity of 1.54 wt% at 0 degrees C under the pressure range between 0.1 atm and 120 atm.

The activation procedure and the hydrogen sorption kinetics of these alloys were studied by thermogravimetry at different temperatures in the range from 100 C to 380 degrees C. It has been found that these alloys can reach reversible gravimetric hydrogen storage densities of up to 4.8 wt.%-H-2.

Following the initial reports of this catalytic ef feet, further kinetic improvement and stabilization of the cyclable hydrogen capacity have been achieved upon variation in the method of the introduction of titanium and particle-size reduction. Rapid evolution of 4.0-wt% hydrogen at 100 degreesC has been consistently achieved for several dehydriding/rehydriding cycles. An improved, 4.8-wt% cyclable capacity has been observed in the material doped with a combination of Ti and Zr alkoxide complexes. Doping the hydride with Ti(OBu(n))(4) and Fe(OEt)(2) also produces a synergistic effect, resulting in materials that can be rehydrided to 4 wt% at 104 degreesC and 87 atm of hydrogen within 17h. The improved kinetics allowed us to carry out constant-temperature. equilibrium-pressure studies of NaAlH(4) that extended to temperatures well below the melting point of the hydride. The 37-kJ/mol value determined for enthalpy of the dehydriding of NaAlH(4)(s) to Na(3)AlH(6) and Al and the hydrogen plateau pressure of 7 arm at 80 degreesC are in line with the predictions of earlier studies.

The most viable clean, green and alternative energy carrier is hydrogen that can meet out the challenges posed towards energy scarcity. So, the present work focus on the effective storing of hydrogen on non-carboneous (Ah-BN) and hydrogen rich metal hydride (NaBH4) based storage medium. where a facile chemical impregnated method was adopted for the preparation of NaBH4/Ah-BN nanocomposite. The structural, morphological, elemental composition and specific surface area analysis of the prepared NaBH4/Ah-BN nanocomposite confirms the presence of NaBH4 wrapped around Ah-BN and enhanced specific surface area of 154.4 m(2) g(-1)(NaBH4/Ah-BN) from 68.2 m(2) g(-1) (Ah-BN). The presence of NaBH4 not only increases the specific surface area but also increases the pore volume thereby creating more defects. In contrast the presence of Ah-BN drastically reduces the decomposition temperature of NaBH4. The amount of stored hydrogen (Sievert's-like hydrogenation setup) was 3.8 wt% at 119 degrees C and the binding energy falls in the recommended range (0.33 -0.50 eV) of US-Department of Energy (DOE) 2025 targets. All the thermal analysis [thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)] ensures the two-step dehydrogenation for NaBH4/Ah-BN. Moreover, the utilization of NaBH4/Ah-BN as an electrode to store hydrogen electrochemically reveals the attainment of 2550 mAh/g discharge capacity during 15 cycles that equals to 4.10 wt% hydrogen storage capacity. Hence, these excellent characteristics proved that the prepared NaBH4/Ah-BN nanocomposite may serve as an excellent weakly chemisorbed hydrogen storage system and electrode material to store hydrogen electrochemically in the realm of Hydrogen Fuel cells.

However, flow-field design of the bipolar end plates, among various other parameters, largely affects its performance. Thus, the present paper focuses on determining hydrogen storage capacity of a typical activated carbon (aC) electrode employed in a reversible modified PEM fuel cell with varied designs of flow-field. Three flow-field orientations-pin-type, parallel, and interdigitated-are used and their performance is evaluated. The fabrication method of the electrode, reversible modified PEM fuel cell, and different orientations of micro flow channels is disclosed. The characterization of the employed aC electrode is done using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The fabricated cells are tested by linear voltage sweep and results are recorded. The result analysis revealed that the interdigitated flow-field design leads to better distribution of the reactants and encourages higher hydrogen adsorption in the carbon electrode compared to the other flow-field designs under consideration. The electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity of the carbon electrode with interdigitated flow-field design is found to be 1.47 weight percentage (wt. %), whereas for parallel and pin-type designs, it stands at 1.40 wt. % and 1.36 wt. %, respectively.

Unfortunately, the improvement and the underlying mechanisms of hydrogen storage kinetics of these materials are far from being fully understood. Herein, the hydrogen storage properties of amorphous and crystalline Mg85Ni5Y10 (at%) alloys prepared by melt-spinning and induction-melting, respectively, were comparatively studied. The results indicate that the hydrogen storage capacity and hydrogen release/uptake kinetics of the melt-spun alloy are much higher and faster than that of the induction-melted alloy. The reversible storage capacity of 4.2 wt% H2 for the activated melt-spun Mg85Ni5Y10 alloy is much higher than 3.8 wt% for the induction-melted sample at 200 degrees C.

Hydride-infiltrated samples were synthesized by melt infiltration, achieving loadings up to 21 wt %. MOF-74(Mg) possesses one-dimensional, 12 angstrom channels lined with Mg atoms having open coordination sites, which can serve as sites for Ti catalyst stabilization. MOF-74(Mg) is stable under repeated hydrogen desorption and hydride regeneration cycles, allowing it to serve as a nanoreactor. Confining NaAlH4 within these pores alters the decomposition pathway by eliminating the stable intermediate Na3AlH6 phase observed during bulk decomposition and proceeding directly to NaH, Al, and H-2, in agreement with theory. The onset of hydrogen desorption for both Ti-doped and undoped nano-NaAlN4@MOF-74(Mg) is similar to 50 degrees C, nearly 100 degrees C lower than bulk NaAlH4. However, the presence of titanium is not necessary for this increase In desorption kinetics but enables rehydriding to be almost fully reversible.

The apparent activation energy for the LiBH4 decomposition in the LiBH4 + 0.5AlH(3) composite estimated by Kissinger's method is remarkably lowered to 122.0 kJ mori compared with the pure LiBH4 (169.8 kJ moll. Besides, AlH3 also improves the reversibility of LiBH4 in the LiBH4 + 0.5AlH(3) composite. For the LiBH4 + xAlH(3) (x = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0) composites, the decomposition kinetics of LiBH4 are enhanced as the AlH3 content increases.

The presence of LiBH4 during the milling process noticeably modifies the size and morphology of the Mg agglomerates, leading to faster hydrogenation and reaching almost the theoretical hydrogen capacity owing to enhanced hydrogen diffusion mechanism. However, the dehydrogenation of the system at low temperatures (<= 300 degrees C) is still slow. Thus, FeF3 addition is proposed to improve the dehydrogenation kinetic behavior. From experimental results, it is found that the presence of FeF3 results in an additional size reduction of the Mg agglomerates between similar to 10 and similar to 100 mu m and the formation of stable phases such as MgF2, LiF and FeB. The FeB species might have a catalytic effect upon the MgH2 decomposition.

The hydrogen sorption and desorption behavior in the composite was investigated for the temperature and pressure ranges of (593-653) K and (0-3) MPa, respectively. According to the pressure-composition -temperature isotherms of hydrogen sorption/desorption, the MgH2-5 wt%MIL-101(Cr) composite starts to absorb hydrogen at a lower pressure at 593 K. In addition, the hydrogen release peak for composite shifts to lower temperatures by about 140 K compared to the pure milled MgH2 during temperature programmed desorption at a heating rate of 6 K/min. The activation energy of hydrogen desorption from the composite is 120 +/- 2 kJ/mol, which is 36% lower than the activation energy of hydrogen desorption from magnesium hydride (189 +/- 2 kJ/mol). The enthalpy of hydrogen absorption was found to be 73 kJ/mol H2 and 60 kJ/mol H2 for milled MgH2 and MgH2-5 wt%MIL-101(Cr) composites, respectively. It is showed that the MIL-101(Cr) MOF structures decompose during ball milling and the chromium oxide nanoparticles form a core-shell structure with MgH2 particles. Thus, composite has better sorption and desorption properties than pure magnesium/magnesium hydride due to the nanoconfinement of MgH2. The chromium oxide nanoparticles act as active sites on the surface of the magnesium particles and facilitate the dissociative chemisorption or recombinative desorption of hydrogen. The main regularities of the phase transition in the magnesium-hydrogen system for the composite and magnesium hydride during dehydrogenation have been studied for temperatures in the range of 298-750 K. The in situ analysis of the phase transitions during the dehydrogenation of MgH2 and MgH2-5 wt%MIL-101(Cr) composite indicates a pronounced catalytic effect of the addition of MIL-101(Cr) to the Mg/MgH2.

A chemical composition that substantially accelerates hydrogen desorption was found. It was observed that carbon improves the hydrogen desorption kinetics significantly. Its beneficial effect was found to be optimum close to the carbon concentration of about c(C) congruent to 5 wt.%. With this composition, stored hydrogen can be desorbed readily at temperatures down to about 485 K, immediately after hydrogen charging. This can substantially shorten the hydrogen charging/discharging cycle of storage tanks using Mg-Ni-based alloys as hydrogen storage medium. For higher carbon concentrations, unwanted phases precipitated, likely resulting in deceleration of hydrogen desorption and lower hydrogen storage capacity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Reducing the reaction temperature from 300 degrees C to 100 degrees C, as well as the use of a t-butyllithium precursor instead of an n-butyllithium precursor, gave significant improvements on the degree of confinement of the LiH particles.

Thereinto, magnesium-based materials (MgH2) are currently deemed as an attractive candidate due to the potentially high hydrogen storage density (7.6 wt%), however, the stable thermodynamics and slow kinetics limit the practical application. In this study, we design a ternary transition metal sulfide FeNi2S4 with a hollow balloon structure as a catalyst of MgH2 to address the above issues by constructing a MgH2/Mg2NiH4-MgS/Fe system. Notably, the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation of MgH2 has been significantly improved due to the synergistic catalysis of active species of Mg2Ni/Mg2NiH4, MgS and Fe originated from the MgH2-FeNi2S4 composite. The hydrogen absorption capacity of the MgH2-FeNi2S4 composite reaches to 4.02 wt% at 373 K for 1 h, a sharp contrast to the milled-MgH2 (0.67 wt%). In terms of dehydrogenation process, the initial dehydrogenation temperature of the composite is 80 K lower than that of the milled-MgH2, and the dehydrogenation activation energy decreases by 95.7 kJmol(-1) compared with the milled-MgH2 (161.2 kJmol(-1)).

The oxides have an orthorhombic perovskite structure (GdFeO3 type) and are characterized by an average particle size of 80-300 nm. The effect of perovskites on the hydrogenation of magnesium during the milling process and the improvement of hydrogen sorption-desorption kinetics is demonstrated.

While during the first hydrogenation cycle the ECAP-modified alloy exhibited faster absorption than its as-cast counterpart, this advantage was lost after the second hydrogenation cycle; parity was regained after six cycles. We attributed these differences in the hydrogen absorption kinetics to the formation of large (tens of micrometers) faceted Mg crystals observed during the first hydrogenation cycle. These crystals were significantly larger in the ECAP-modified alloy than in its as-cast counterpart. We discussed the growth of large Mg crystals during hydrogenation in terms of self-diffusion of Mg atoms driven by the metal-hydride transformation stress.

The amounts of oxygen and water in the glovebox were below 0.1 ppm. The gases released from the materials during the thermal decomposition of all samples were analyzed using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The oxidation of MgH2 at low oxygen and water vapor pressures leads to an increase in the hydride decomposition temperatures of the samples compared to their initial (as-prepared) counterparts, which are shown in Ref. [1]. The differences in the decomposition temperatures between the powders stored for one year in a glovebox and the initial as-prepared powders were greater than 60 degrees C for MgH2 with NbF5, ZrF4, TaF5, TiCl3 and VCl3. The release of water from all long-term-stored materials and the emission of hydrogen fluoride (HF) from MgH2 with metal fluorides were observed during heating. The observed results demonstrate that even a protective argon atmosphere did not prevent the degradation of the nanocrystalline MgH2 powders with various metal halide additives during their long-term storage in a professional glovebox, which is an important practical concern.

In the recent decades, hydrogen has emerged as potential source of clean energy. One of the potential alternatives to achieve the objective is the designing and characterization of materials for hydrogen-storage energy applications. In this regard, metalbearing hydrides are the most promising candidates. For instance, magnesium-bearing hydrides are the focus of current research work owing to high hydrogen capacity of 7.6 wt%. In this paper, we first time report density functional-based quantum theoretical analysis to explore the potential of Mo-doped magnesium hydrides MgH2:Mo for optoelectronic and hydrogen-storage applications. For the quantum computations of the required optoelectronics and energy storage properties, we employed all-electron methods within generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Besides applying GGA approximation to account for the electronic correlated effects, we employed the Hubbard potential U (= 4 eV) for onsite repulsive Coulomb force. We predict that 10% doping by weight of Mo into MgH2 suppresses its insulating band gap of 4.9 eV to semiconducting band gap of order 3.15 eV for spin up and 0.15 eV for spin down. As such the doping of Mo can tune the the bandgap, structural, electronic and optoelectronic properties of MgH2 considerably for potential applications.& COPY; 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The MgH2-Co/Pd@B-CNTs composite starts to release hydrogen at 198.9 degrees C, which is 132.4 degrees C lower than as-milled MgH2. The hydrogen desorption activation energy for MgH2 is reduced from 178.00 to 76.66 kJ mol(-1) by the catalytic effects of Co/Pd@B-CNTs. The MgH2-Co/Pd@B-CNTs composite shows dramatically improved absorption kinetics; it rapidly uptakes 6.68 wt% H-2 within 10 s at 250 degrees C, and quickly absorbs 1.91 wt% H-2 within 100 s, even at a temperature as low as 50 degrees C.

Therefore, in this study, interaction of LiAl(NH2)(4) and LiAlH4 has been investigated by means of mechanical milling and thermal method. It was found that dehydrogenation occurred spontaneously during the milling process and the rate of dehydrogenation increased with increasing amount of LiAlH4, suggesting an ion migration mediated dehydrogenation. As reaction progressed, the formation of Li3AlH6 as an intermediate was detected and a total of 8 equiv. of H-2 (7.5 wt%) can be released, forming LiH and AlN as the final product. In contrast, heating the homogenously ground LiAl(NH2)(4) and LiAlH4 sample resulted in the release of NH3 at low temperatures, indicating that NH3 mediation would take place in case of dehydrogenation. Further increase in temperature resulted in a rapid release of hydrogen from the interaction of the LiAl(NH)(2) and LiAlH4.

Furthermore, the presence of carbon atom in the cages permits linking the metallacarboranes to form metal organic frameworks, which are thus able to adsorb hydrogen via Kubas interaction, in addition to van der Waals physisorption.",,,,,"Singh, Abhishek/AAM-1028-2021; Yakobson, Boris/ABA-3897-2020; Singh, Abhishek/IXH-7418-2023","Singh, Abhishek/0000-0002-7631-6744; Yakobson, Boris/0000-0001-8369-3567;",,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-7863,1520-5126,,,,OCT 13,2010,132,40,,,,,14126,14129,,10.1021/ja104544s,0,,,,,,,,20860355,,,,,WOS:000282660100050,0

The prepared alloy exhibited good chemical composition after laser deposition, compared to the nominal composition, which was further improved using high-temperature annealing at 1000 degrees C for 24 h. Better powder quality and the optimization of the LENS parameters are still necessary for obtaining the improved chemical homogeneity of the alloy after synthesis. The alloy exhibited a two-phase structure, i.e., the dominant C14 Laves phase matrix with a minor amount of the alpha-Ti solid solution, after synthesis and annealing. The PCT isotherms were measured up to 100 bar of hydrogen pressure at 50 degrees C after activation of the alloy by annealing at 500 degrees C for 2 h under vacuum. The obtained maximum hydrogen capacity was 1.81 wt.% after synthesis and 1.56 wt.% after additional annealing. The equilibrium pressure of hydrogen desorption was too low for a complete desorption reaction, resulting in the presence of a C14 hydride phase in the alloy after PCT tests.

CuO nanoparticles produced from MOF-199, as well as their graphene templated counterpart ([CuO]@Gr), have been employed to improve the hydrogen sorption properties of the front-running hydride (MgH2). The MgH2-(CuO) and MgH2-(CuO)@Gr have been studied in terms of their hydrogen sorption properties. The onset desorption temperature for (CuO)@Gr catalyzed MgH2 has been found to be 229 degrees C, which is 121 degrees C and 12 degrees C lower than MgH2 and MgH2-(CuO). The MgH2-(CuO) sample absorbs hydrogen of 5.02 wt % in 1 minute, and 5.22 wt% in 5 minutes and desorbs 1.48 wt% in 5 minutes, and 5.55 wt% in 20 min at 290 degrees C. However, the MgH2-(CuO)@Gr sample absorbs hydrogen to the tune of 6.01 wt% in 1 minute and 6.22 wt% in 5 min and desorbs 2.32 wt% in 5 minutes and 6.01 wt% in 12 minutes at 290 degrees C. The activation energy of (CuO)@Gr catalyzed MgH2 has been found to be 82.83 kJ/mol, which is lower by 77.23 kJ/mol from BM MgH2. The change in desorption enthalpy for MgH2-(CuO) sample has been found to be 75.18 kJ/ mol and 68.34 kJ/mol for the MgH2-(CuO)@Gr sample, respectively. A remarkable impact of graphene addition is that the storage capacity hardly changes on cycling here and remains -6 wt% even after 10 cycles without any substantial deterioration. Repeated cycling further leads to the formation of Cu nanoparticles and prevents agglomeration during cycling.

We present an investigation of the initial hydriding characteristics, as well as the compositional transformation of composites made of La2Mg17 + LaNi5 mechanically milled in a 2:1 weight ratio. Composites produced with varying durations and intensities of milling were tested. Those milled to the greatest extent proved to have the best initial hydrogen absorption and desorption kinetics. The kinetics of the most heavily milled composite were superior to those of La2Mg17. This composite absorbed 90% of its full hydrogen capacity (3.5 wt.% H-2) in less than 1 min at 250 degrees C and desorbed the same quantity of hydrogen in 6 min. Under the same conditions pure La2Mg17 took 2.5 h to absorb and 3 h to desorb 90% of its full hydrogen capacity (4.9 wt.% H-2). Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction were used to characterize the mechanically milled powders before and after hydriding. The unhydrided powders consisted of LaNi, grains surrounded by a fractured La2Mg17 matrix.

The element substitutions in LaNi5 can significantly change the hydrogenation properties, allowing to tune them to a large extent. It could be very advantageous to partially replace Ni or La with other elements to reduce the cost of this alloy as well as the equilibrium pressure of absorption and desorption. The hydrogen storage properties of ball-milled AB5 alloys containing the elements La, Ce (A-rare elements) and Ni, Fe (B-transition metals) were studied in this paper. Although the substitution of Ni (atomic radius 1.49 angstrom) with Fe atom (atomic radius 1.56 angstrom) increased the unit cell volume from 86.4149 to 87.947 5 angstrom 3 of the LaNi5 phase, its hydrogen storage capacity was still close to the value 1.4 wt %. The enthalpy (Delta H) of hydride formation for hydrogen absorption and desorption of the experimental alloys was in the range of 29-32.6 kJ/mol. A very favorable effect of Fe on the sorption properties was found in the significant reduction of the equilibrium pressure of absorption and desorption. These studied experimental Fe-containing alloys were able to store hydrogen at 300 K and with pressure under 0.1 MPa. The fastest sorption kinetics of hydrogen was found in alloys with FeNi phase particles located on the surface of the powder.

The hydride composites were obtained by high-energy reactive ball milling (RBM). The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The cycling performance of hydrogen desorption and absorption as well as hydrogen generation in the hydrolysis reaction were studied. We found that during the reactive ball milling the studied composites are able in a few minutes to absorb -6.5 wt% of hydrogen. The addition of Zr3V3O0.6 and Zr3V3O0.6 + C catalysts not only increases the rates of hydrogen absorption and release, but also lowers the activation energy and the temperature of hydrogen desorption. For a composite containing 10 wt% of suboxide and 3 wt% of graphite, the activation energy of hydrogen desorption determined by the Kissinger method was very low, just 58 kJ/mol, and this value is among the lowest described in the reference publications. We also show that the intermetallic additive forms the Zr3V3O0.6H-10 hydride, which results in a higher gravimetric capacity of the composite as H storage material. The improved kinetics of hydrogen exchange and increased hydrogenation capacity at modest operating temperatures of 150-200 degrees C appear to be characteristic for the composites containing suboxide and graphite additions. The reason for the advanced performance is in the different the morphology of the synthesized samples, particularly the graphitecontaining composites showing a more developed dispergation of the material (the fraction with a particle size of 1-3 mu m is >80 wt%). We furthermore show that the synthesized materials can be used in the hydrolysis process resulting in hydrogen generation.

The alloy contains a C15 FCC intermetallic compound as the main phase and a LaNi secondary phase as the minor constituent (similar to 1 wt%).

The selected isothermal temperature range is considered as an optimal condition for hydrogen sorption enhanced steam reforming. When hydrogenation and dehydrogenation were performed in pure hydrogen gas and in vacuum, a large reversible hydrogen capacity of 3.95 wt. % H was obtained, demonstrating completeness of the formation and decomposition of (Ti,V)-dihydrides. However, when cycling was performed in a flow of hydrogen gas, the reversible hydrogen capacity decreased to similar to 2 wt. % H caused by the formation of stable lower (Ti,V)-hydrides. A further decrease in the reversible hydrogen storage capacity took place when pure hydrogen gas was replaced by a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide CO. This decrease was caused by the formation of an oxygen rich layer on the surface of the alloy, which was partially blocking the hydrogen exchange between the surface and the bulk of the sample.

It is shown that by creating traps (structural, impurity) for hydrogen by introducing additional elements into the metal structure or by changing the structure (intermetallides), also by other methods, the hydrogen solubility of the metal can be changed to a greater or lesser extent depending on the technical requirements. Ni-B samples were obtained in the sulfamate nickel electrolyte using boron compounds of the class of higher polyhedral borates Na2B10H10. The use of nanoforming boron additives provides measured hydrogen content in Nix-By-Hz samples about of 600 cm(3)/100 g. Nickel-indium composites were obtained by electrolytic deposition on copper substrates (0,05 mm thick), with electrolyte composition: NiSO4 x 7H(2)O 1/4 140 g/L; Na2SO4 x 10H(2)O 1/4 20 g/L; and In-2(SO4)3 which concentration varied from 1 g/L to 12 g/L. Variations in the amount of In-2(SO4)(3) ensured the production of Ni-In composites with different component ratios. The obtained data made it possible to select the optimal mode of deposition of Ni-In plating in the In-2(SO4)(3) electrolyte. In order to determine the effect of each of the electrodepositing parameters on the properties of the samples, only one parameter varies: either the cathode current density or the concentration of indium in the electrolyte. The samples of different concentrations of In are synthesized and studied. Their phase composition was determined. X-Ray phase analysis reveals in the Ni-In composites synthesized from electrolytes with In-2(SO4)(3) concentration of more than 2 g/L, a phase corresponding to the intermetallide h-In27Ni10. For the first time in the practice of studying sorption, electrochemical composites Ni-x-In-y, including subsequent thermal desorption of hydrogen, are studied by implanting deuterium into the samples. It is demonstrated spectra of deuterium thermal desorption from Ni70In30Dx composites, which allowed determining the temperature ranges of desorption of ion implanted deuterium depending on the dose of implantation. It is confirmed that a Ni70In30 composite capable of retaining doped deuterium (hydrogen) has been obtained.

The thermal conductivities of the composite pellets with carbon nanotubes were up to 20% higher than thermal conductivities of the reference pellets of pure Mg prepared in a similar way. We demonstrated that the high energy ball milling employed in the synthesis of the composites has destroyed the carbon nanotubes and transformed them into chains of carbon nanoparticles of 20-30 nm in diameter. The hydride phase grew preferentially along these chains, resulting in anisotropic microstructure, with residual Mg phase forming an interpenetrating, percolating network contributing to the long-range thermal transport. On the contrary, the residual Mg formed isolated pockets in the reference pellets of pure Mg. Our work demonstrates that anisotropic additives to the hydride forming metals can improve their thermal conductivity and hydrogen storage properties by changing the topology of the two-phase metal hydride microstructure.

They are produced by mechanical alloying or melt-spinning and they are good candidate materials for hydrogen storage applications. In this communication we modified the Ti45Zr38Ni17 compounds by substituting 3d metals (cobalt) for Ni to obtain amorphous phase. The cobalt atoms are located at the same positions as nickel. We describe a series of phase transitions associated with a hydrogen uptake in the amorphous Ti45Zr38Ni17-xCox alloys that were prepared by mechanical alloying. The investigated alloys exhibited a high capacity for gaseous H-2 reaching 2.2 wt.% at elevated temperatures. It has been found, that the amorphous powders were decomposed into simple hydrides being exposed to H-2 at temperatures above 200 degrees C. In order to overcome that problem, a processing route to obtain the amorphous hydrides was established. The heated amorphous hydrides underwent an unusual and fascinating transformation into the glassy quasicrystal phase with no hydrogen loss. A further temperature increase triggered another structural transformation into the cubic phase, which was associated with hydrogen release from the structure. The crystal structure evolution was characterized by the variety of diffraction techniques.

Using a magnetically controlled Uni-Ball-Mill, small amounts of the iron oxides, Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, were ball milled with Mg powder in a hydrogen atmosphere (Mg to Fe atomic ratio; 20: 1). Milling products as well as samples used in hydrogen absorption/desorption experiments were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. TG analysis combined with DSC revealed a higher hydrogen storage capacity for the Mg + Fe2O3 + H(2)(.)milled product (6 wt% H) compared with 5 wt% H for Mg + Fe3O4 + H-2. XRD revealed that during heating, both iron oxides were reduced to pure Fe, a result not previously reported for similar materials milled using different milling devices. For both samples, there was little difference found in the decomposition temperature of the as-prepared MgH2 and rehydrogenated composites. However, storage capacity degradations were observed for the rehydrogenated composites (4 wt% H storage capacity for MgH2 + Fe2O3 and 4.4 wt% H for MgH2 + Fe3O4). The higher capacity degradation of rehydrogenated MgH2 + Fe2O3 composite is also believed to be a result of the reduction reaction, during which more magnesium was consumed than was consumed by the same amount of Fe3O4. The results also were related to the particular ball-milling equipment and low-energy shearing milling mode employed, which promoted the development of a nanostructural hydride product which subsequently changed structure significantly during the first desorption cycle.

However, the detailed information about the complete evolution process of Ni in the 2LiBH(4)-MgH2 system is still insufficient and deserves further research. Herein, an interesting phenomenon that inconspicuous exothermic process coupled with unimpressive hydrogen-releasing behavior at a relatively moderate temperature range (150-300 degrees C) was found in the typical 2LiBH(4)-MgH2 RHC system when doped with nanosized Ni/C derived from the pyrolysis of MOFs-74-Ni. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra of 2LiBH(4)-MgH2-15%Ni/C sample under various temperatures confirm that chemical valence of Ni presents a distinct intermediate state. After that, phase analysis indicates that Ni most likely reacts with LiBH4 to form a temporary Ni4B3, and a series of meticulous supplementary data were calculated to identify the authenticity of the proposed assumption. More precisely, the experimental calorific value (15.43 mJ) and hydrogen release capacity (0.47 wt%) are highly consistent with the theoretical calculation value (15.66-15.99 mJ and 0.48 wt%) of the proposed reaction. It is revealed that the Ni4B3 intermediate phase will further transform into catalytic active MgNi3B2 species, which provokes a significantly enhanced kinetic behavior and also high hydrogen storage capacity (above 9.0 wt%) of the 2LiBH(4)-MgH2 RHC system. Finally, the heterogeneous nucleation mechanism of the MgNi3B2 catalytic active substance is also collaboratively verified through careful scanning electron microscope and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. This work ideally reveals the complete evolution process of Ni in the 2LiBH(4)-MgH2 RHC system by the detection of a nanosized intermediate state. More importantly, it provides ideas and inspirations for the other nanosized catalytic complex hydride systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The average nanograin (crystallite) size Of Mg2FeH6 is within the range of similar to2-6 nm as estimated by XRD. The highest yield of Mg2FeH6, Close to similar to34 wt.% as determined by XRD and DSC, is observed after 270 h of direct (no pre-milling) CRMA. The formation of MgO during CRMA is identified as the primary factor that greatly hinders the initial formation Of Mg2FeH6. Pre-milling of elemental Mg-Fe mixture can accelerate formation of Mg2FeH6 but the pre-milling time has not yet been optimized in the present work. The persistent presence of unreacted Fe even after CRMA for as long as 370 h is observed in all powders synthesized in this work. DSC hydrogen desorption temperatures obtained in the present work are much lower than those reported by other researchers for the Mg-Fe-H system. These desorption temperatures (onset and peak) are close to or substantially lower than 300degreesC irrespective of whether the desorbing hydride is either beta-MgH2 or Mg2FeH6 although it must be noted that the lowest DSC desorption peak temperature is associated with the hydrogen desorption from Mg2FeH6. Hydrogen desorption peak temperatures determined by thermally programmed desorption (TPD) are, on average, at least 50degreesC lower than those determined by DSC. Within the range of similar to1 to similar to10 nm nanograin (crystallite) size of beta-MgH2 and Mg2FeH6 no systematic correlation is observed between the DSC and TPD desorption peak temperatures of both hydrides and their nanograin sizes.

Combining the metal hydride reactor with PCM is expected to recover the heat generated during the hydrogen absorption and use it for hydrogen desorption, thus improving the energy efficiency of the system. This paper proposes a metal hydride reactor integrated with honeycomb fins and PCM to enhance heat transfer. Based on simulations, the results show that the achieved hydrogen storage capacity is 1.326 wt%, the gravimetric and volumetric storage densities are 0.411% and 14.76 kg of H2 per m3, respectively, and the mean saturated rates are 1.222 x 10-3 g s-1 and 0.773 x 10-3 g s-1 for absorption and desorption processes. Compared with the reactor without fins, the mass and volume of the reactor using honeycomb fins are increased, resulting in a decrease in gravimetric and volumetric storage density, but a increase in reaction rate during hydrogen absorption and desorption processes. Based on this structure, we also propose a honeycomb fin reactor filled with sandwich PCM to further accelerate the heat transfer in the reaction process. Compare to the reactor with PCM only filled on the periphery of the honeycomb fins, the hydrogen absorption and desorption times are shortened by about 86.4% and 81.1%, respectively.

Two types of copper fins, including disk fins and corrugated fins, and three kinds of baffles, including segmental baffles, diagonal baffles and hole baffles, were applied to enhance the heat transfer in metal hydride tanks. We used the finite element method to simulate the hydrogen refueling process in MH tanks. It was found that the optimized tank with corrugated fins only took 630 s to reach 1.5 wt% saturation level. The intensification on the tube side of tanks is an effective method to improve hydrogen storage performance. Moreover, the shell side flow field and hydrogen refueling time in MH tanks with different baffles were compared, and the simulated refueling time is in good agreement with the experimental data. The metal hydride tank with diagonal baffles shows the shortest hydrogen refueling time because of the highest velocity of cooling water.

It was shown that the introduction of Ti-Mn/CNTs can remarkably improve the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2.

Combination of Ti-Mn alloy and CNTs is more effective than Ti-Mn alloy or CNTs alone for regulating MgH2. Ti-Mn/CNTs does not alter the overall thermodynamics of MgH2. However, local destabilization of Mg-H bonds induced by the MgH2/ Ti-Mn interfaces was observed experimentally and confirmed theoretically, which partially contributes to the enhanced hydrogen storage of MgH2. In addition, the active transition metals contained in the alloy was believed to accelerate the hydrogen dissociation and delivery during the hydrogen storage process.

The hydrogen storage properties of nanoconfined MgH2 were studied by Sieverts' measurements and thermal desorption spectroscopy, which clearly demonstrated that the dehydrogenation kinetics of the confined hydride depends on the pore size distribution of the scaffold material; that is, smaller pores mediated faster desorption rates possibly due to a size reduction of the confined magnesium hydride.",,,,,"Besenbacher, Flemming/A-9623-2010; Hirscher, Michael/J-8030-2015","Hirscher, Michael/0000-0002-3143-2119; Jensen, Torben Rene/0000-0002-4278-3221",,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0851,1936-086X,,,,NOV,2009,3,11,,,,,3521,3528,,10.1021/nn901072w,0,,,,,,,,19883120,,,,,WOS:000271951200026,0

Absorption isotherms were measured using a 2.5-g bed of palladium powder at temperatures between 130 and 393 K and pressures less than 1.3 x 10(5) Pa. Such low-pressure and low-temperature measurements are useful for characterizing palladium beds used for tritium pumping and storage. For tritium storage, pressures are kept below a few millibars for safety reasons. Low temperatures increase the tritium storage capacity of palladium. The measured absorption isotherms show the well-documented, two-phase behavior for this system: two solubility regions and a mixed, hydride-forming region. The isotherms show that an increased quantity of hydride is formed at lower temperatures, as marked by an increase in the hydride-forming region. This region exceeds hydrogen-to-metal ratios of 0.75 for T <= 273 K. Equilibrium pressures in the mixed region decrease with decreasing temperatures until a critical temperature is reached for each isotope. Below these critical temperatures, the rate of pressure decrease with decreasing temperature is significantly reduced. This change in trend suggests hydrogen isotopes are adsorbed onto the palladium surface, rather than forming a hydride. Using the equilibrium pressures recorded at temperatures between 236 and 393 K for protium and between 211 and 354 K for deuterium, the van't Hoff constants were calculated to be A = -36 +/- 1 kJ/mol and B = 88 +/- 3 J/K for protium and A = -32 +/- 2 kJ/mol and B = 88 +/- 9 J/K for deuterium.

The results indicate that the as-milled alloys exhibit a nanocrystalline and amorphous structure, and the amorphization degree of the alloys visibly increases with extending milling time. Prolonging the milling duration markedly enhances the electrochemical discharge capacity and cyclic stability of the alloys. The electrochemical kinetics, including high rate discharge ability (HRD), charge transfer rate, limiting current density (I-L), hydrogen diffusion coefficient (D), monotonously decrease with milling time prolonging.

However, storage still remains a formidable challenge because of the thermodynamic and kinetic issues encountered when binding hydrogen to a carrier. In this study, we demonstrate how the principal binding sites in a new class of hydrogen storage materials based on the Kubas interaction can be tuned by variation of the coordination sphere about the metal to dramatically increase the binding enthalpies and performance, while also avoiding the shortcomings of hydrides and physisorpion materials, which have dominated most research to date. This was accomplished through hydrogenation of chromium alkyl hydrazide gels, synthesized from bis(trimethylsilylmethyl) chromium and hydrazine, to form materials with low-coordinate Cr hydride centers as the principal H(2) binding sites, thus exploiting the fact that metal hydrides form stronger Kubas interactions than the corresponding metal alkyls. This led to up to a 6-fold increase in storage capacity at room temperature. The material with the highest capacity has an excess reversible storage of 3.23 wt % at 298 K and 170 bar without saturation, corresponding to 40.8 kg H(2)/m(3), comparable to the 2015 DOE system goal for volumetric density (40 kg/m(3)) at a safe operating pressure. These materials possess linear isotherms and enthalpies that rise on coverage, retain up to 100% of their adsorption capacities on warming from 77 to 298 K, and have no kinetic barrier to adsorption or desorption. In a practical system, these materials would use pressure instead of temperature as a toggle and can thus be used in compressed gas tanks, currently employed in the majority of hydrogen test vehicles, to dramatically increase the amount of hydrogen stored, and therefore range of any vehicle.",,,,,"Aroca, Ricardo/K-5268-2014; Hoang, Tuan K.

Based on the temperature-programme desorption results, the onset dehydrogenation temperature of the MgH2-Sn composite was consisted of two steps in the range of 235-250 degrees C and 325-340 degrees C. TiF3 catalyst was introduced to enhance the desorption temperature of the MgH2-Sn (4: 1) system. The onset dehydrogenation temperature of the 4MgH(2)-Sn-10 wt% TiF3 composite was reduced to approximately 100 degrees C and 205 degrees C compared to the MgH2-Sn (4:1) and the as-milled MgH2.

The improvement of the dehydrogenation properties of the MgH2-Sn composite with the addition of TiF3 was due to the formation of Ticontaining and F-containing species.

The way to synthesize the target alloy powders was the mechanical milling method, by which the CeMg11Ni + x wt% Ni (x = 100, 200) alloy powders with nanocrystalline and amorphous structure were obtained. The influence of the milling time and Ni content on the hydrogen storage properties of the alloys was discussed.

The hydrogenation/dehydrogenation dynamics were studied using a Sievert instrument and a differential scanning calorimeter which was linked with a H-2 detector. The hydrogen desorption activation energies of the alloy hydrides were evaluated by Arrhenius and Kissinger equations. From the results point of views, there is a little decline in the thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy and entropy changes) with the increase in Ni content. However, the alloys desorption and absorption dynamics are improved distinctly. What is more, the variation of milling time results in a dramatic influence on the hydrogen storage performances of alloys. Various maximum values of the hydrogen capacities correspond to different milling time, which are 5.805 and 6.016 wt% for the CeMg11Ni + x wt% Ni (x = 100, 200) alloys, respectively.

A significant shrinking of the unit cells takes place on a substitution of La with Ce. SR XRD showed the formation of two hexagonal hydrides, a gamma-trihydride La0.5Ce0.5Ni4CoH3, and a saturated beta-hexahydride La0.5Ce0.5Ni4CoH similar to 6. In addition, an alpha-H solid solution was experimentally observed. Hysteresis of hydrogen absorption and desorption between the flat single plateaus isotherms measured during the PCT measurements was rather small, with no indication of the formation of the thermodynamically stable gamma-(La,Ce)(Ni,Co)(5)H-3. The SR XRD revealed that (a) the relative abundance of the gamma-hydride is higher during the desorption compared to the absorption; its relative amount reaches 50 wt.% in maximum; (b) anisotropic strains in all constituent phases during both hydrogen absorption and desorption are not developed; (c) the pressure of the formation of the gamma-phase was found to be strongly temperature-dependent. The formation of large amounts of metastable gamma-(La,Ce)(Ni,Co)(5)H-3 hydride in quasiequilibrium experimental conditions applied during the SR XRD experiments and during reaching the thermodynamic equilibrium between the constituent phases can be responsible for the reduced hysteresis of the PCT isotherms and absence of noticeable anisotropic strains in the constituent phases.

The composition, phase components, microstructure and hydrogen sorption properties of the composite powders were carefully investigated. Composition analyses revealed a reduction in TM and La contents for all powders when compared with the compositions of their precursors. It is observed that the composites are all mainly composed of ultrafine Mg covered by nano La2O3 introduced during passivation. Based on the Pressure Composition Temperature measurements, the hydrogenation enthalpies of Mg are determined to be -68.7 kJ/mol H-2 for Mg-Ti-La powder, -72.9 kj/mol H-2 for Mg-Fe-La powder and -82.1 kJ/mol H-2 for Mg-Ni-La powder. Meantime, the hydrogen absorption kinetics can be significantly improved and the hydrogen desorption temperature can be reduced in the hydrogenated ternary Mg-TM-La composites when compared to those in the binary Mg-TM or Mg-RE composites. This is especially true for the Mg-Ni-La composite powder, which can absorb 1.5 wt% of hydrogen at 303 K after 3.5 h. Such rapid absorption kinetics at low temperatures can be attributed to the catalytic effects from both Mg2Ni and La2O3. The results gathered in this study showed that simultaneous addition of 3d transition metals and 4f rare earth metals to Mg through the arc plasma method can effectively alter both the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of Mg ultrafine powders for hydrogen storage.

The onset dehydrogenation temperature of nano LiBH4-PMMA-co-BM is reduced to similar to 80 degrees C (Delta T=340and 170 degrees C as compared with milled LiBH4 and nanoconfined LiBH4 in carbon aerogel, respectively). At 120 degrees C under vacuum, nano LiBH4-PMMA-co-BM releases 8.8 wt.% H-2 with respect to LiBH4 content within 4 h during the 1st dehydrogenation, while milled LiBH4 performs no dehydrogenation at the same temperature and pressure condition. Moreover, nano LiBH4-PMMA-co-BM can be rehydrogenated at the mildest condition (140 degrees C under 50 bar H-2 for 12 h) among other modified LiBH4 reported in the previous literature. Due to the hydrophobicity of PMMA-co-BM host, deterioration of LiBH4 by oxygen and humidity in ambient condition is avoided after nanoconfinement. Although the interaction between LiBH4 and the pendant group of PMMA-co-BM leads to a reduced hydrogen storage capacity, significant destabilization of LiBH4 is accomplished.

Complex metal hydrides such as NaAlH4 and LiBH4 have attractive hydrogen contents. However, hydrogen release and especially uptake after desorption are sluggish and require high temperatures and pressures. Kinetics can be greatly enhanced by nanostructuring, for instance by confining metal hydrides in a porous carbon scaffold. We present for a detailed study of the impact of the nature of the carbon-metal hydride interface on the hydrogen storage properties. Nanostructures were prepared by melt infiltration of either NaAlH4 or LiBH4 into a carbon scaffold, of which the surface had been modified, varying from H-terminated to oxidized (up to 4.4 O/nm(2)). It has been suggested that the chemical and electronic properties of the carbon/metal hydride interface can have a large influence on hydrogen storage properties. However, no significant impact on the first H-2 release temperatures was found. In contrast, the surface properties of the carbon played a major role in determining the reversible hydrogen storage capacity. Only a part of the oxygen-containing groups reacted with hydrides during melt infiltration, but further reaction during cycling led to significant losses, with reversible hydrogen storage capacity loss up to 40% for surface oxidized carbon. However, if the carbon surface had been hydrogen terminated, similar to 6 wt% with respect to the NaAlH4 weight was released in the second cycle, corresponding to 95% reversibility. This clearly shows that control over the nature and amount of surface groups offers a strategy to achieve fully reversible hydrogen storage in complex metal hydride-carbon nanocomposites.

Using ab initio calculations and experimental methods, the role of alloying magnesium with aluminum was determined. The hydrogen content in the Mg and Mg-10 at%Al coatings was 1.8 wt% and 4.5 wt%, respectively. For the Mg-10 at%Al coating, the peak temperature of hydrogen desorption was about 425 degrees C, 17 degrees C lower than that for the Mg coating. The desorption rate for the Mg coating and Mg-10 at%Al coating was 3 x 10-14 mol(H2)/cm2 s and 31 x 10-14 mol(H2)/cm2 s, respec-tively. Compared with the Mg coating, the higher hydrogen content in the Mg-10 at%Al coating with the faster hydrogen desorption is related to the energetically more favorable Al-doped Mg system than the pure Mg system with H at the distance from Al at low hydrogen concentrations. The lower hydrogen desorption temperature of the Mg-10 at%Al coating is confirmed to be the consequence of the weakened MgeH bond by the doped Al atom due to the higher electronegativity of the Al atom than that of the Mg atom. In addition, the aluminum binding energy decreases more significantly with the hydrogen concentration in-crease for hydrogen near Al atom than for hydrogen at a distance.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Increasing the amount of C had the effect of decreasing (from 10 to 3) the number of cycles needed for activation (performed at 623 K and 40 bar/0.9 bar charging/discharging H-2 pressure). After full activation, the 5 wt % C-containing sample exhibited the best absorption kinetics performance: the average rate to charge up to 5 wt % H-2 was about 3 times higher than that observed for the undoped sample. Unfortunately, increasing the amount of C had a negative impact on the desorption behaviour, causing an increase in the dehydrogenation activation energy and a decrease in the discharging rates. Within the present study, C reacted neither with H-2 nor with the H-2 active phases (the two discharged phases Mg and Mg2Ni and the related hydrides) and consequently did not lead to variation in the sorption enthalpies of the Mg-Ni system. But, its presence did cause a small increase (4 K at 0.9 bar H-2) in the minimum desorption temperatures of the hydrides and a consequent minor decrease (0.2 bar) in the equilibrium pressures. The best sorption properties were obtained for the 5 wt % C-sample, that on the whole worked better than the binary mixture. (C) 2009 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The selected configuration is a cylindrical reactor of 32 cm of diameter where the MeH is filled in annular tubes separated from the complex hydride bed by a gas permeable layer. The diffusion of hydrogen towards the two storage media is ensured by filters embedded in the middle of the MeH tubes whereas the coolant tubes are placed in the centre of their triangular arrangement. Simulation results have shown that the charging process depends on the MeH reaction heat required for the initiation of the CxH reaction as well as the heat management once the complex hydride starts to store hydrogen. High hydrogen storage rates and short refueling times can be obtained by increasing the number of MeH and coolant tubes and ensuring an efficient heat removal at the peripheral area of the CxH media. A refueling time of 3 min is achieved for an optimum configuration of 49 MeH tubes and 96 coolant tubes while increasing the thermal conductivity of the CxH media to 3.5 W/(m K). Such a result could make the identified optimum configuration as a suitable hydrogen storage system for fuel cell forklift trucks since it meets the requirements of this application in terms of weight and size.

The new materials produced have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transition electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electron energy dispersion spectrum (EDS) for their phase compositions, crystal structure, grain size, particle morphology and the distribution of catalyst element. Hydrogen storage capacities and the hydriding-dehydriding kinetics of the new materials have been measured at different temperatures using a Sieverts apparatus. The results show that amorphous/nanostructured composite material Mg 50 wt.%-Ni 50 wt.% absorbs 5.9 wt.% within 5 min and desorbs 5.1 wt.% hydrogen within 15 min at 250degreesC, respectively. It is confirmed that mechanical alloying that reduces particle size and introduces mechanical stress accelerates the hydrogenation kinetics of the magnesium based materials even at low temperature. But, to release the absorbed hydrogen from the mechanical alloyed materials, a high temperature is still required. It is believed that the dehydriding temperature is largely controlled by the thermodynamic stability of magnesium hydride. It is found that doping Mg-Ni nano/amorphous composite materials with lanthanum, cerium and LaNi5 alloy reduces the hydriding and dehydriding temperatures. The composite material Mg 80 wt.%-LaNi5 20 wt.% absorbs 1.96% hydrogen and releases 1.75 wt.% hydrogen at 25degreesC, which suggests the formation of unstable hydrides. Although the stability of MgH2 cannot be easily reduced by ball milling alone, the results suggest the thermodynamic behavior of Mg-Ni nano/amorphous composite materials can be alternated by additives such as La, LaNi5 or other effective elements.

Fast H-sorption kinetics at around 300 degrees C can be achieved after processing Mg-based mixtures by high energy ball milling (HEBM), which produces nanostructured composite powders. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) processing techniques are being explored as an alternative to HEBM in order to obtain more air-resistant materials and to reduce the time and energy required for processing. In this paper, MgH2 and MgH2-Fe mixtures were severely mechanically processed by extensive cold forging (CF) and cold rolling (CR). A very significant grain refinement (up to 10 nm) was achieved, which is comparable to the values typically obtained after processing by HEBM. Enhanced H-sorption properties were observed for these mechanically processed MgH2-based nanocomposites in comparison with commercial magnesium hydride. The obtained compacts after CR and CF presents a much lower specific surface area than the ball-milled powders and therefore show higher air-resistance. These results are promising from the point of view of applications since it reveals the potential of the use of low cost mechanical processing routes to produce Mg-based nanomaterials for hydrogen storage.

Thanks to the unique properties of rare earth elements, the partial substitution of Y can not only improve the activation properties and plateau pressure of the alloys, but also increase the effective hydrogen storage capacity of the alloys.

This paper determines the low energy structures of Sn(AlH4)4 and Zr(AlH4)4 crystals by using global optimization algorithm combined with density functional theories, and analyze their electronic structures and bonding properties. The most stable structures of Sn(AlH4)4 and Zr(AlH4)4 contain isolated H2 molecules. The formation en-thalpies of Zr(AlH4)4 reaches 1.0 eV and the value of Sn(AlH4)4 is a little smaller. In Zr(AlH4)4, the AlH5, AlH6 and Al2H6 units are connected tightly by Zr atoms through H bridges. In Sn(AlH4)4, the AlH6 units form a net structure, and the Sn atom exists in SnH3 with one shared H atom. The bonding characteristics are analyzed by calculating charge populations and crystal orbital hamilton population (COHP). The metal components (Al, Sn, Zr) and H atoms form polarized covalent bonds. The covalent contributions are close for Sn-H and Al-H bonds but the charge values on the Sn atoms are much smaller. For the Zr-H bonds, both the charges on the Zr atoms and the covalent contributions are smaller than the values of the Al-H bonds. Combining the bonding natures and the structure features, it suggests that proper electronegativity of the metal atoms (Sn and Zr here) is the key factor for the stabilities and reversible hydrogen storage properties of metal aluminum hydrides.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The hydrogen storage performance test indicates that the hydrogen dissociation pressure of ZrFe1.9Ga0.1 and ZrFe1.9Al0.1 is 164.0 atm and 130.7 atm at 298 K, respectively. Our work demonstrates that ZrFe2-based alloys with a small Ga or Al substitution are suitable for high-pressure hydrogen storage applications. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The research focuses on the effect of milling duration on the thermodynamics and dynamics. The instruments of researching the gaseous hydrogen storing performances include Sievert apparatus, DSC and TGA. The calculation of dehydrogenation activation energy was realized by applying Arrhenius and Kissinger formulas. The calculation results show the specimen milled for 10 h exhibits the optimal activation performance and hydrogenation and dehydrogenation kinetics. Extending or shrinking the milling duration will lead to the degradation of hydrogen storage performances. The as milled (10 h) alloy at the full activated state can absorb 4 wt% hydrogen in 87 s at 473 K and 3 MPa and release 3 wt% H-2 in 288 s at 573 K and 1 x 10(-4) MPa.

To address this, researchers have turned their attention to hydride materials, which offer safe and efficient hydrogen storage capacity. In this study, we employed density functional theory calculations to investigate the structural and optoelectronic properties of LiMgF3-xHx (x = 0, 1, 2, and 3) hydrides, aiming to gain insights into their potential role in hydrogen storage. The optimized lattice parameter decreases from 3.95 to 3.86 A = with the inclusion of hydrogen. Further, we analyzed the density of states and band structure of each LiMgF3-xHx (x = 0, 1, 2, and 3) perovskite hydride, which depicts the decreasing trend in the bandgap due to increasing concentration of H. The Burstein-Moss shift and bandgap renormalization effects have been determined to assess the shifting of the absorption edge, which results in the narrowing of the bandgap. Furthermore, optical parameters were examined within the range of 0-10 eV, demonstrating a significant redshift in the absorption spectra in the UV region. The alteration in the optical properties and bandgap reduction are discussed in detail. Among the various hydrogen insertions, LiMgH3 displayed the highest static refractive index [n (0) = 2.01] and dielectric function, exhibiting minimal losses in absorption. These results emphasize that LiMgH3 is a promising candidate for hydrogen storage applications. Interestingly, the gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen storage capacities improved significantly from 1.4 to 8.8 wt% and 26.93-86.59 g.H2/l, respectively, which is a consequence of the increasing concentration of hydrogen in the host compound.

Typical MgH2 dehydrogenation enthalpy (76 +/- 1 kJ mol (1) (H-2)) and entropy (138 +/- 2 J mol (1) K (1) (H-2)) values observed by the 0.65MgH(2)/0.35ScH(2) sample demonstrated the effect of ScH2 was purely a catalytic improvement of the kinetics.

The study compares two methods for dispersing Fe NPs in MC: (i) ultrasonication nanoconfinement (un) and (ii) post-nanoconfinement (pn) via stir-ring. Based on the results, it is found that the ultrasonication nanoconfinement method can effectively disperse the FeNPs with 5 nm in MC support (FeNP-un-MC), later which can efficiently confine MBH (FeNP-un-MC@MBH system). The hydrogen (H2) desorption properties of the FeNP-un-MC@MBH system were found to be better than that of post-confinement-mediated FeNP-pn-MC@MBH system. For instance, H2 started to desorb from the FeNP-un-MC@MBH system at only 66 degrees C (Tonset) and reached its peak at-153 degrees C, compared to 270 degrees C (Tonset) and its peak-350 degrees C for pure MBH, respectively. The ultrasonication-mediated nanoconfined FeNP-un-MC@MBH system released a total of 7.01 wt% H2 within 90 min at 350 degrees C. The study shows that the activation energy (Ea) of FeNP-un-MC@MBH is 19.57 kJ/mol, achieved due to the improved dehydrogenation kinetics of MBH. These improvements are due to the synergistic effects of nano-compartmentalization and highly dispersed Fe NP catalyst sites in the MC support.

The thermal decomposition required higher temperature, and a significant portion of NaH remains undecomposed. Thus, a suitable catalyst is required to lower the decomposition temperature and increase the hydrogen generation rate. Result: A series of catalyst/NaH hydrogen storage materials were systematically investigated. The facile solution method was used to synthesize the composite material with CaO, CaF2, and CaCl2 as catalysts. The hydrogen generation via thermolysis from the composite material was studied using in-situ flow reactors. The generated hydrogen was quantified using a gas chromatograph (GC). Adding CaO (catalyst) was beneficial to lower the thermolysis temperature of NaH, and the hydrogen generation increased from similar to 0.31 wt% to similar to 1.94 wt% at 100 degree celsius. The CaO assisted in the dispersion of NaH and lowered the activation energy to decompose and generate more hydrogen by thermolysis at low temperatures. The synthesized composite materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) studies. Conclusion: The generation of hydrogen was -1.94 wt% with 10CaO/NaH >1.68 wt% with 5CaO/NaH >1.61 wt% with 15CaO/NaH >1.41 wt% with 20CaO/NaH >0.31 wt% with pure NaH at 100 degree celsius.

Four major stages were discovered in the undoped and TiF3-doped system, which is corresponding to; (i) Ca(AlH4)(2), (ii) CaAlH5, (iii) CaH2 and (iv) NaBH4, respectively. The addition of TiF3 to the studied composite resulted in both reduced decomposition temperature and enhanced sorption kinetics compared with the undoped composite. The onset desorption temperature was reduced from 125 degrees C to 60 degrees C for the first stage in the TiF3-doped composite, compared with the undoped composite.

The maximum values of effective thermal conductivity for the bed configurations of LMP/CMPGF/CMPGFCu were 1.3/4.7/6.8 W m(-1) K-1. These values of effective thermal conductivity were obtained at 70 bar hydrogen gas pressure and 60 degrees C average bed temperature. The decrease in mass fraction of hydrogen absorbed by the La0.8Ce0.2Ni5 hydride, as a result of implementation of ETC augmentation techniques, was nominal (around 5.7% in case of CMPGF and 4.5% in case of CMPGFCu) when compared to the respective powder bed configurations.

In this study, a metal hydride reactor using LaNi5 as metal hydride and using water as heat transfer fluid flowing through embedded helical tube was fabricated and experimentally studied. The aim of this study is to experimentally investigate the effect of internal heat transfer arrangement on the absorption and desorption of hydrogen in a metal hydride system. The effect of mass flow rate and temperature of heat transfer fluid, effect of hydrogen supply pressure on the rate of hydrogen absorption and desorption was investigated. It was found that the increase in the hydrogen supply pressure, increase in mass flow rate and decrease in the temperature of heat transfer fluid, results in faster hydrogen absorption rate. Similarly, the increase in mass flow rate and the temperature of heat transfer fluid results in faster hydrogen desorption rate. It was also found out that maximum hydrogen absorbed inside metal hydride reactor was around 34.5 g which corresponds to a gravimetric capacity of 1.34 wt%. Further based on the experimental data various machine learning models were developed and tested and then these models were used for performance prediction. It was found that tree-based regression machine learning models are better compared to other models. Such models can thus be used for prediction of rate of hydrogen absorbed or desorbed and metal hydride bed temperature for different parametric values without doing detailed experimental and numerical trial. Finally, the brute force approach is used to optimize the system for three different applications. The optimization techniques help to fix the value of parameters for particular application and hence save multiple experimental run of absorption and desorption. This is a novel work in the field of using machine learning for modelling and optimizing the metal hydride-based reactor.

In this work, a series of heterophase Mg-Ni-based composites are synthesized via the hydriding combustion synthesis (HCS) method. The in situ-formed MgNi2 can serve as highly reactive and air-stable sites for hydrogen dissociation, leading to superior dehydrogenation kinetic properties of the heterophase composites.

Surface characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the lower surface segregation and oxidation of MgNi2 compared to Mg2NiH4 is responsible for improving the dehydrogenation performance. Moreover, the heterophase composites can be preserved, transferred, and operated under environmental conditions without specific treatment or strict atmosphere, which is an essential feature in practical applications.

Unlike reversible metal hydrides, which operate near equilibrium, metastable hydrogen carriers rely on kinetic barriers to limit or prevent the release of hydrogen and can be prepared in a stabilized state far from equilibrium. Despite the advantage of low temperature hydrogen release, this type of one-way thermolysis reaction can be difficult to control since the hydrogen release rate varies with temperature and composition. Here we developed a kinetic rate equation from a series of isothermal measurements, which describes the relationship between temperature, hydrogen release rate and composition for aluminum hydride. This equation is necessary to thermally control the rate of hydrogen release throughout decomposition. This equation was used to run a fuel cell at a controlled rate of similar to 1 wt%/hr. Although the equation established in this paper relates specifically to aluminum hydride, the method used is applicable to other metastable hydrides. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Still, its stable thermodynamics and sluggish kinetics are the main obstacles to the widespread application, which can be solved by the exploration of an efficient catalyst to improve its hydrogen storage performance. In this study, sodium fluotitanate (Na2TiF6, NTF) as an additive was introduced into MgH2 through ball milling to enhance its hydrogen storage performance because there is a potential formation of fluoride, titanium-containing substance and sodium-bearing species that are beneficial for performance improvement. Unsurprisingly, the mechanism analysis shows that the in-situ generated TiH2, MgF2, NaMgH3, and TiF4 catalytically active species can realize the dual regulation of kinetic and thermodynamic properties, which together coordinate the enhancement of the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2. The starting hydrogen release temperature of MgH2-NTF-10 is significantly decreased to 226 degrees C, about 183 and 33 degrees C lower than pristine MgH2 and as-milled MgH2, respectively. About 6.1 wt% of hydrogen can be re-leased at 300 degrees C in only 30 min with a much lower activation energy of 143.08 kJ/mol. Moreover, the reversible hydrogen storage performance is well displayed for MgH2-NTF-10 after ten cycles of hydrogen de/ absorption, with 95% hydrogen storage capacity retention. Our results show that the synergistic functions of multiphase active components from the three-in-one additive of NTF may advance MgH2 further to prac-tical applications. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Tests of the tank were carried out in a temperature range from 150 degrees C (H-2 absorption) to 370 degrees C (H-2 desorption) and showed its ability to deliver up to 185 NL H-2 corresponding to a reversible H storage capacity of the MH material of appr. 5 wt% H.

However, there remains a challenge to produce a material capable of simultaneously optimizing two conflicting criteria-absorbing hydrogen strongly enough to form a stable thermodynamic state, but weakly enough to release it on-demand with a small temperature rise. Many materials under development, including metal-organic frameworks, nanoporous polymers, and other carbon-based materials, physisorb only a small amount of hydrogen (typically 1-2 wt%) at room temperature. Metal hydrides were traditionally thought to be unsuitable materials because of their high bond formation enthalpies (for example MgH2 has a Delta H-f similar to 75 kJ mol(-1)), thus requiring unacceptably high release temperatures resulting in low energy efficiency. However, recent theoretical calculations and metal-catalysed thin-film studies have shown that microstructuring of these materials can enhance the kinetics by decreasing diffusion path lengths for hydrogen and decreasing the required thickness of the poorly permeable hydride layer that forms during absorption. Here, we report the synthesis of an air-stable composite material that consists of metallic Mg nanocrystals (NCs) in a gas-barrier polymer matrix that enables both the storage of a high density of hydrogen (up to 6 wt% of Mg, 4 wt% for the composite) and rapid kinetics (loading in < 30 min at 200 degrees C).

The interatomic distances between the H delta+ s from the NH3 units and the H delta- s from the BH4 units are in the range of 1.91-2.19 angstrom, suggesting the presence of significant H delta+ ...

Mass spectrometry, thermogravimetry and temperature-programmed desorption studies of metal cation-modified aluminum-based borohydride ammoniates using the reactions of various metal borohydrides M(BH4)(n) (M = Na, Li, Ca, Mg) and chlorides MCln (M = Sc, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mg, Ca, Li) reveal that their dehydrogenation properties are strongly dependent on the polarizing power of the added metal cations. It is hypothesized that the added metal cations may activate the borohydride ion to such an extent that its H delta- can easily react with the H delta+ of the [Al(NH3)(6)](3+) cation, resulting in an enhanced interaction between the H delta+ and H delta-, thus enhancing their dehydrogenation kinetics. Subsequent deuterium isotope and X-ray measurements support the hypothesis that the H delta+ ... H-delta interactions play a role in the dehydrogenation of the metal borohydride ammoniates.

This novel transition metal and g-C3N4 catalytic composites could provide alternative insights into designing nanosized catalytic hydrogen storage system with low desorption temperature and high capacity for hydrogen-fueled applications.",,,,,"Fan, Xiulin/AAY-9245-2020; Fan, Xiulin/AAJ-9893-2020; yao, zhendong/HLW-6120-2023; Xiao, Xuezhang/E-8439-2010; Xiao, Xuezhang/AAB-4833-2022","Fan, Xiulin/0000-0001-7294-480X; Xiao, Xuezhang/0000-0003-4035-5044",,,,,,,,,,,,,2405-8297,,,,,JUL,2018,13,,,,,,199,206,,10.1016/j.ensm.2018.01.012,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000436924800023,0

In addition, this synergistic effect of TiO2 on the improvement of the absorption/desorption performances was related to the formation of Al3Ti and TiH2 phases in the doped sample upon desorption, which reinforces the interaction of MgH2 with LiAlH4.

One of the main issues with the application of hydrogen energy is a shortage of security and efficient hydrogen storage technology. TiMn-based alloys are considered promising hydrogen storage materials, but their comprehensive hydrogen storage properties and cyclic stable performance limit their further practical application. The hydrogen storage properties of alloys can be enhanced by substituting transition metal elements.

Aspects of hydrogen absorption kinetics, all of the alloys can reach full hydrogen absorption saturation within 400 s at 303 K. The Ti09Zr01Mn095Cr07V02Mo0.15 alloy possessed the fastest hydrogen absorption kinetic rate (t(0.9) = 65 s) and the smallest hysteresis factor. This suggests that the substitution of Mo elements is effective in improving the hysteresis of the Laves phase alloys.

In-situ synchrotron radiation powder X ray diffraction and thermal desorption spectroscopy measurements were performed to analyze the product distributions formed during the thermal decomposition of LiMg(AlD4)(3). The first decomposition step occurs at about 120 degrees C and the second at about 160 degrees C for the as-milled sample, while for a purified sample of LiMg(AlD4)(3), the decomposition temperatures involving release of hydrogen increase to 140 and 190 degrees C, respectively, suggesting that pure samples of LiMg(AlD4)(3) are kinetically stabilized. Studies of the purified LiMg(AlD4)(3) also showed that the second decomposition step can be divided into two reactions: 3LiMgAlD(6) -> Li3AlD6 + 3MgD(2) + 2Al+ 3D(2) and Li3AlD6 -> 3LiD + Al + 3/2D(2). Addition of TiCl3 to LiMg(AlD4)(3) under a variety of ball milling conditions consistently led to decomposition of LiMg(AlD4)(3) during milling. Correspondingly, all attempts to rehydrogenate the (completely or partially) decomposed samples at up to 200 bar hydrogen pressure failed. Decomposition of MgD2 was observed at relatively low temperatures. This is ascribed to thermodynamic destabilization due to the formation of different AlxMgy phases, and to kinetic destabilization by addition of TiCl3. A thermodynamic assessment was established for the calculation of phase stability and decomposition reaction relationships within the Li-Mg-Al-H system. The calculations confirmed the metastability of the Li-Mg(AlH4)(3) phase and the irreversibility of the Li-Mg alanate phase decomposition reactions. The Li-Mg alanate decomposition pathways followed experimentally could be explained by the endothermicity of the calculated decomposition enthalpies, in that an impure or catalyzed LiMgAlH6 intermediate phase could more directly access an endothermic decomposition reaction at lower temperatures, while a kinetically-hindered, purified LiMgAlH6 would require higher temperatures to initiate the two-step decomposition through an exothermic reaction.

As a result, the MgH2-CPF com-posite prepared at 823 K initially dehydrogenates at 557 K, 94 K lower than the as-milled MgH2 (651 K). Meanwhile, the composite can release 5.67 wt% H2 within 1000 s at 623 K. Even at a lower temperature of 423 K, the MgH2-CPF composite still reabsorbs 5.62 wt% H2 within 3600 s, while the as-milled Mg can hardly absorb hydrogen under a same condition. Furthermore, by addition of CPF, the apparent activation energy of the system is decreased from 161.2 kJ/mol to 87.2 kJ/mol.

The release of H-2 from the H-storage (absorbent) material is hindered by the on-set of reaction mechanism which depends on the energy barrier. In a search for efficient onset (re)hydrogenation temperature, stimuli like catalysts have drawn more attention in the hydrogen fuel economy. It is laborious to down-select the aspirant candidates by screening their material properties and the thermochemical energy which are required for bond breaking. An understanding on perceptible energies involved in breaking/creating bonds has been obtained using the novel Interface Reaction tool. To enlighten the underpinning catalytic reaction mechanism to the absorbent, the energetics of interactions between the catalyst and the solid metal hydrides have been derived. For this test study, a leading catalyst TiFx (x = 4,3, and 2) has been added to the well-studied high gravimetric metal hydrides such as MgH2, Mg(BH4)(2), and Mg(AlH4)(2). The reaction equation at ambient condition has been validated using the total energies from Kohn-Sham density-functional-theory, and the outcome emphasizes the importance of bonding analysis. Hence, we exemplified the bonding states of all the Ti-F derivatives namely TiF4, TiF3 and TiF2 in an effort to elucidate the role of fluorine for the onset of catalytic reaction. Our detailed analysis of reaction pathways indicate the vitality of TiF4 as an additive before and after the H-2 release. Our work pioneers the study on often overlooked reaction possibilities at ambient condition. The calculated reaction energy of less than 40 kJ/mol and 4.64 wt % of H-2 release for TiF4 and TiF3 underscores their catalytic activity and meet the system targets set by DoE for the year 2020.

Results show that LiBH(4)/MgH(2) composite milled with 10 wt.% purified SWNTs additive can release nearly 10 wt.% hydrogen within 20 mm at 450 degrees C, which is about two times faster than that of the neat LiBH(4)/MgH(2) sample. On the basis of hydrogen storage behavior and structure/phase investigations, the possible mechanism involved in the property improvement upon carbon additives was discussed. (C) 2009 Professor T.
